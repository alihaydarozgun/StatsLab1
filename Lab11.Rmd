X <- c(1,4,3,2,5,4,3,6,7,8)

Y <- c(1,3,6,7,8,2,8,7,6,9)

1. An X and Y variable contain the above numbers.

      A. Compute Pearson’s 𝑟 and report the associated p-value using the cor.test() function. (2 points)

      B. Use a permutation test to create a null-distribution, and report the p-value for getting the observed correlation or larger using your simulated null-distribution. (2 points)

2. Using the variables X and Y above, and assuming that the values could be re-ordered in any way, report the following:

      A. the smallest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)

      B. the largest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)
  
  
```{r}

X <- c(1,4,3,2,5,4,3,6,7,8)
Y <- c(1,3,6,7,8,2,8,7,6,9)

#Ploting the distribution
hist(sim_rs)


length(sim_rs[sim_rs >= cor(X,Y)])/1000

X <- c(1,4,3,2,5,4,3,6,7,8)
Y <- c(1,3,6,7,8,2,8,7,6,9)

sum(X*Y) # current order of the X and Y variable


# Producing most negative relationship between this two variable;

sort(X)  # put the number from smallest the larger

sort(Y, decreasing = TRUE) # goes from biggest to smallest

sum(sort(X)*sort(Y, decreasing = TRUE))

```


    B. the largest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)


```{r}

sum(sort(X)*sort(Y))
